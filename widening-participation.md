## ANYWAY today I'm offering you my take on deciding what to do next*

##

- *Naturally YMMV, I'm not a clairvoyant etc etc. 
- I intend to be helpful and would like to be told if I'm not. 
- We'll mostly be considering what to do after college.

# Deciding what to do next

## How I think I decided

##

- friends going to University (because their parents went?)
- think I'll try and go too
- list possible degrees with pros/cons
- check out what's required, decide to get what's required and work hard to get it

##

- for me this was medicine because I thought it'd be interesting and worthwhile (pro) though a lot of hardwork (con?)
- lots of people told me I had made a bad decision
- the advice (and support) you get depends on your environment
- whether you can compete with the people from other environments depends on you 

## How I think you should decide

##

- try and think critically about it
- an options list with pros and cons isn't a bad idea (I'd include not going to university and not staying in this country here)
- think about how you'd like life to be and how life will be for you after the next step 
- consider debt, likely future earnings, lifestyle you want etc

##

- pick your target(s)
- make sure you know what's needed to hit them
- make sure you're up for putting in the necessary work
- make sure you enlist the help of others, pick the right people to ask, but stay critical

# Any questions?
